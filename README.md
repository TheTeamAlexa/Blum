# How to Use

## Command Line Options / Arguments

This script/program supports several argument parameters that can be used. Here's an explanation of the arguments:

`--data` / `-D`: Used when you have a different filename for storing account data. By default, the filename used by this script/program to store account data is `data.txt`. For example, if you have a file named `query.txt` as the file storing account data, just run `bot.py` with the `--data` / `-D` argument. Example: `python bot.py --data query.txt`

## Termux

1. Make sure your device has Python and Git installed.

    Recommendation: Use Python version 3.8+ (3.8 or newer)
   
    Install Python
   ```shell
   pkg install python3
   ```
   Then use all of these command at once
   ```shell
   pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install python rust git -y
pkg install nano
git clone https://github.com/TheTeamAlexa/Blum.git
cd Blum
pip install -r requirements.txt
nano data.txt
   ```
2. Edit the `data.txt` file, enter your query data into the `data.txt` file. One line for 1 account, if you want to add a 2nd account, fill it in on a new line.

6. Run the program/script.
   ```
   python Blum.py
   ```

# Viewing Reports

To view a report of the total balance of all accounts you can run a file called `report.py`

4. Open console
5. Ð¡opy this code in Console for getting tgWebAppData (user= / query=):

```javascript

```

6. you will get data that looks like this

```

You can add more and run the accounts in turn by entering a query id in new line like this:
```txt
query_id=xxxxxxxxx-Rxxxxujhash=cxxx
query_id=xxxxxxxxx-Rxxxxujhash=cxxxx
```

| Error                 | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wrong format | This is because the query ID you have pasted has a extra Space so close your bot and try again and take a look during the editing of ``` nana data.txt ```           |
